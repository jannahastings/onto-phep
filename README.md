# Overview

The Ontology for Phenomenological Psychopathology (OPheP) is an ontology for representing entities from phenomenological approaches to psychopathology for use in research and clinical practice. 

The project is being developed using the BFO upper level ontology and following best practices as set out by the OBO Foundry. It is developed beneath the Mental Functioning ontology as a general mid-level ontology for the psychological and psychiatric domains. 

Current contributors to this effort include Janna Hastings, Rasmus Rosenberg Larsen, Guilherme Messas, Valter Piedade, Luca Fasciolo Maschi√£o.
