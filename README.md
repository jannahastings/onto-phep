# Overview

The Ontology for Phenomenological Psychopathology (OPheP) is an ontology for representing entities from phenomenological approaches to psychopathology for use in research and clinical practice. 

The project is being developed using the BFO upper level ontology and following best practices as set out by the OBO Foundry. It is developed beneath the Mental Functioning ontology as a general mid-level ontology for the psychological and psychiatric domains. 

Current contributors to this effort include Janna Hastings, Rasmus Rosenberg Larsen, Guilherme Messas, Valter Piedade, Luca Fasciolo Maschião. 

## Viewing the ontology

To **view the ontology**, download this repository and open the file `OPHEP.owl` in the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) ontology editing tool. 


## Contributing to the ontology

There are several ways to **contribute** to the development of this ontology.  

If you would like specific content added or changed, either create an *Issue* in this repository with details of the specific requests, or if you are already familiar with the structure and content of the ontology you can suggest additions directly to specific .csv files in the *src/templates* folder with a pull request. 

To join the discussion about the entities and the further development of the ontology, get in touch with the developers.
